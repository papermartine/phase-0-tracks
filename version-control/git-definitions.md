# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control tracks changes made to code. This can help reference iterations and if necessary, rollback revisions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch contains specific actions made to code. You would use this to write changes and merge with master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in version control. A good commit message clearly states the action performed in the code change.

* What is a merge conflict?

A conflict can occur if two branches you are trying to merge both changed the same part of the same file.
